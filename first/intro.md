# Docker Compose

In the previous lessons we have learned about containers, images, building an image, and running the container. Now we will build on that foundation to automatically build 2 containers to support a distributed architecture: 

1. A web server exposed to the Internet
2. A database server which tracks number of page views which is not exposed to the Internet.
